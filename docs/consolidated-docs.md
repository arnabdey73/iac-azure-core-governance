## Governance Framework Overview

### Azure Core Governance Framework

#### Overview

The Azure Core Governance Framework provides a comprehensive approach to implementing enterprise-scale governance across Azure environments. This framework is built on Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

#### Governance Pillars

##### 1. Management Group Hierarchy

The framework implements a standardized management group structure:

```text
Root Management Group
├── Platform
│   ├── Management
│   ├── Connectivity
│   └── Identity
├── Landing Zones
│   ├── Production
│   └── Non-Production
├── Sandbox
└── Decommissioned
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Inherited policy and RBAC assignments
- Scalable organizational structure
- Support for multiple environments

##### 2. Policy Governance

###### Built-in Policies

- Azure Security Benchmark
- Regulatory compliance baselines (ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS)
- Cost management policies

###### Custom Policies

- Mandatory tagging requirements
- Allowed locations for resource deployment
- Security baseline enforcement
- Network security requirements

###### Policy Assignment Strategy

- **Root Level**: Core security and compliance policies
- **Platform Level**: Infrastructure-specific policies
- **Landing Zone Level**: Workload-specific policies
- **Sandbox Level**: Relaxed policies for development

##### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

###### Custom Roles

- **Landing Zone Contributor**: Manage resources without governance changes
- **Platform Reader**: Read-only access to platform resources
- **Security Operator**: Manage security configurations

###### Assignment Strategy

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Separation of Duties**: Clear role boundaries
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Automated compliance checking

##### 4. Security & Compliance

###### Microsoft Defender for Cloud

- Advanced threat protection across all resource types
- Security recommendations and alerts
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

###### Security Center Configuration

- Auto-provisioning of monitoring agents
- Integration with Log Analytics workspace

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) >= 2.30.0
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows) or PowerShell Core 7+ (Cross-platform)

#### Azure Requirements

- Azure Active Directory tenant
- Appropriate permissions:
  - Owner or User Access Administrator at tenant root
  - Global Administrator (for AAD operations)
- At least one Azure subscription

#### Service Principal Setup (for CI/CD)

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "sp-azure-governance" \
  --role "Owner" \
  --scopes "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{tenant-id}"
```

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd iac-azure-core-governance
   ```

2. Install Terraform (Windows)

   ```bash
   winget install HashiCorp.Terraform
   ```

3. Configure Backend Storage (Optional but Recommended)

   ```bash
   # Variables
   RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="rg-terraform-state"
   STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stterraformstate$(date +%s)"
   CONTAINER_NAME="tfstate"

   # Create resource group
   az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location "West Europe"

   # Create storage account
   az storage account create \
     --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
     --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
     --sku Standard_LRS \
     --encryption-services blob

   # Create container
   az storage container create \
     --name $CONTAINER_NAME \
     --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME
   ```

4. Configure Variables

   ```bash
   cp terraform-es/terraform.tfvars.example terraform-es/terraform.tfvars
   # Edit the variables file
   # Update organization_name, subscription_ids, and other values
   ```

5. Update Backend Configuration

   Edit `terraform-es/main.tf` and uncomment the backend configuration:

   ```hcl
   backend "azurerm" {
     resource_group_name  = "rg-terraform-state"
     storage_account_name = "your-storage-account-name"
     container_name       = "tfstate"
     key                  = "governance.tfstate"
   }
   ```

### Deployment Process

#### Method 1: Local Deployment

1. Initialize Terraform

   ```bash
   cd terraform-es
   terraform init
   ```

2. Validate Configuration

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. Plan Deployment

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   ```

4. Apply Configuration

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   ```

#### Method 2: Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. Import Repository

   - Create new project in Azure DevOps
   - Import this repository
   - Configure service connections

2. Create Service Connections

   - Go to Project Settings > Service connections
   - Create Azure Resource Manager connection
   - Use service principal authentication
   - Name: `azure-governance-prod` and `azure-governance-dev`

3. Configure Variable Groups

   - Go to Pipelines > Library
   - Create variable group: `terraform-backend`
   - Add variables: `backendResourceGroupName`, `backendStorageAccountName`, `backendContainerName`

4. Create Environments

   - Go to Pipelines > Environments
   - Create environments: `azure-governance-prod`, `azure-governance-dev`
   - Configure approval gates for production

5. Run Pipeline

   - Go to Pipelines
   - Create new pipeline using `azure-pipelines.yaml`
   - Run the pipeline

### Post-Deployment Verification

- Verify Management Groups

  ```bash
  az account management-group list --output table
  ```

- Check Policy Assignments

  ```bash
  az policy assignment list --output table
  ```

- Verify Security Center

  ```bash
  az security contact list --output table
  ```

- Check Log Analytics Workspace

  ```bash
  az monitor log-analytics workspace list --output table
  ```

### Configuration Customization

- Adding Subscriptions: Update `subscription_ids` in `terraform.tfvars`, run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`
- Custom Policies: Add policy definitions in `terraform-es/policies/main.tf`, create policy assignments as needed, update and apply configuration
- Additional Management Groups: Edit `terraform-es/management-group/main.tf`, add new management group resources, update outputs and dependencies
- RBAC Customization: Uncomment role assignments in `terraform-es/role-assignments/main.tf`, replace placeholder Principal IDs with actual group IDs, add custom role definitions as needed

### Troubleshooting

- Permission Errors: Ensure service principal has Owner role at tenant root, check AAD permissions, verify subscription assignments
- Backend Storage Issues: Check storage account access, verify container exists, ensure correct storage account name in backend config
- Policy Assignment Failures: Some policies require specific resource providers, check policy definition syntax, verify management group hierarchy
- Terraform State Issues: Check backend configuration, verify state file permissions, consider state file migration if needed

### Useful Commands

```bash
az account show
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription "subscription-id"
terraform show
terraform import azurerm_management_group.example /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/example
terraform refresh
terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
```

### Maintenance and Updates

- Monthly: Review policy compliance reports, update Terraform and provider versions, review and update documentation
- Quarterly: Review governance framework, update policies, conduct security assessments
- Annually: Complete governance framework review, update compliance requirements, review and update disaster recovery procedures
- Provider Updates: `terraform init -upgrade`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`
- Adding New Features: Create feature branch, implement changes, test in development, create pull request, deploy to production after approval

### Security Considerations

- Credential Management: Never store credentials in code, use Azure Key Vault, implement credential rotation, use managed identities
- Network Security: Implement network segmentation, use private endpoints, enable DDoS protection, regular security assessments
- Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor all administrative actions, set up alerts for policy violations, regular security reviews, incident response procedures
