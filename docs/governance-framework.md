# Azure Core Governance Framework

## Overview

The Azure Core Governance Framework provides a comprehensive approach to implementing enterprise-scale governance across Azure environments. This framework is built on Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Governance Pillars

### 1. Management Group Hierarchy

The framework implements a standardized management group structure:

```
Root Management Group
├── Platform
│   ├── Management
│   ├── Connectivity
│   └── Identity
├── Landing Zones
│   ├── Production
│   └── Non-Production
├── Sandbox
└── Decommissioned
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Inherited policy and RBAC assignments
- Scalable organizational structure
- Support for multiple environments

### 2. Policy Governance

#### Built-in Policies
- Azure Security Benchmark
- Regulatory compliance baselines (ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS)
- Cost management policies

#### Custom Policies
- Mandatory tagging requirements
- Allowed locations for resource deployment
- Security baseline enforcement
- Network security requirements

#### Policy Assignment Strategy
- **Root Level**: Core security and compliance policies
- **Platform Level**: Infrastructure-specific policies
- **Landing Zone Level**: Workload-specific policies
- **Sandbox Level**: Relaxed policies for development

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Custom Roles
- **Landing Zone Contributor**: Manage resources without governance changes
- **Platform Reader**: Read-only access to platform resources
- **Security Operator**: Manage security configurations

#### Assignment Strategy
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Separation of Duties**: Clear role boundaries
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Automated compliance checking

### 4. Security & Compliance

#### Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Advanced threat protection across all resource types
- Security recommendations and alerts
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

#### Security Center Configuration
- Auto-provisioning of monitoring agents
- Integration with Log Analytics workspace
- Custom security assessments

### 5. Monitoring & Logging

#### Centralized Logging
- Activity logs from all subscriptions
- Security events and alerts
- Policy compliance monitoring
- Custom dashboards and workbooks

#### Alerting
- Policy violations
- Security incidents
- Compliance drift
- Cost anomalies

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Deploy management group hierarchy
2. Implement core policies
3. Set up monitoring infrastructure
4. Configure security baseline

### Phase 2: Governance Controls (Weeks 3-4)
1. Deploy custom policies
2. Implement RBAC strategy
3. Configure Security Center
4. Set up alerting and monitoring

### Phase 3: Landing Zones (Weeks 5-6)
1. Deploy standardized landing zones
2. Implement workload-specific policies
3. Configure networking and security
4. Test and validate governance controls

### Phase 4: Operational Excellence (Weeks 7-8)
1. Implement automation and CI/CD
2. Set up compliance monitoring
3. Train teams on governance processes
4. Establish operational procedures

## Compliance Frameworks

The framework supports multiple compliance standards:

### ISO 27001
- Information security management
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Security controls implementation

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Continuous monitoring and improvement
- Risk-based security approach

### PCI DSS
- Payment card industry standards
- Data protection requirements
- Network security controls

### SOC 2 Type II
- Security, availability, confidentiality
- Processing integrity
- Privacy controls

## Cost Management

### Governance Controls
- Budget policies and alerts
- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Spending limits for sandbox environments
- Cost optimization recommendations

### Monitoring and Reporting
- Cost by management group
- Department and project cost allocation
- Monthly cost trending and forecasting
- Resource utilization analytics

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

### Backup Strategy
- Automated backup policies
- Cross-region backup replication
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Backup compliance monitoring

### High Availability
- Multi-region deployment patterns
- Load balancing and failover
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Recovery time and point objectives

## Governance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Policy compliance percentage
- Security recommendation remediation time
- Cost variance from budget
- Resource provisioning time

### Monitoring and Reporting
- Monthly governance reports
- Compliance dashboards
- Security posture assessments
- Cost optimization recommendations

## Best Practices

### Security
- Enable MFA for all administrative accounts
- Use managed identities where possible
- Implement network segmentation
- Regular security assessments

### Operations
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Implement Infrastructure as Code
- Use version control for all configurations
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

### Cost Optimization
- Right-size resources regularly
- Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Implement auto-shutdown for development resources
- Regular cost reviews and optimizations

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Quarterly policy reviews
- Monthly security assessments
- Weekly cost optimization reviews
- Annual governance framework updates

### Training and Documentation
- Governance framework training for teams
- Regular updates to documentation
- Best practices sharing sessions
- Incident response procedures
